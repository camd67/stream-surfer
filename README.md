# StreamSurfer
StreamSurfer is a search engine for users who often stream entertainment online, but struggle to find the legal sources to do so. For example, if a user were to search for a movie or TV show on a popular search engine theyâ€™d get legal and illegal results as well as non-stream results. With StreamSurfer, users are able to easily search for the show or movie they want to watch, returning back links to online legal streams for that show or movie on well-known streaming platforms as well as lesser-known platforms that are completely legal, as well as information about the movie or TV show.
