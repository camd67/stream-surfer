# StreamSurfer
StreamSurfer is a search engine for users who often stream entertainment online, but struggle to find the legal sources to do so. For example, if a user were to search for a movie or TV show on a popular search engine theyâ€™d get legal and illegal results as well as non-stream results. With StreamSurfer, users are able to easily search for the show or movie they want to watch, returning back links to online legal streams for that show or movie on well-known streaming platforms as well as lesser-known platforms that are completely legal, as well as information about the movie or TV show.

## Functionalities
* Search for shows and movies  
* View details about the show or movie, such as the genre, actors, etc.  
* Browse through list of movies and shows by genre  
* View what streaming platforms chosen show or movie is available on  
* Create a user profile to see recently watched shows and movies  
* Add shows and movies to personal list for future viewing
* See viewing status of the show or movie (watched, currently watching, etc.)
* Rate the show or movie on a scale of 1 to 5 stars

## Built With
* DigitalOcean: Linux virtual server  
* ASP .NET Core: Framework for building the application using C#    
* Postgres: Database management system
* Reasons for choosing this stack: We chose this stack by having 3 main considerations: ease of use, existing knowledge, and low cost. Digital ocean gave us a virtual server at a low cost, along with ASP .NET Core and Postgres as they are both free. This let us get up and running with very little monetary investment. We have had experience developing on Digital Ocean web servers before, so working with it on this project would be relatively easy. In addition to this, anyone who wishes to work with StreamSurfer will be able to quickly and easily setup a similar system. Our team also had a good amount of existing knowledge about these systems, easing development. Since our stack is fully open source, other developers have few barries towards learning from or working on StreamSurfer.
