            StreamSurfer ("us", "we", or "our") operates <a href="https://streamsurfer.info">https://streamsurfer.info</a> (the "Site"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site.
            We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. You can contact us at streamsurferinfo@gmail.com.
        </p>

        <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>

        <p>While using our site, we collect no personal information except for what is detailed in the Log Data section. If however, you decide to create an account on Streamsurfer you have to provide a username, email, and password. These pieces of information are required in order to have you log into your account, and to contact you as outlined in the Communications section. We store and transport your personal information as securely as possible including full in-transit encryption using up to date TLS across the entire site. Your password and email will never be transmitted to a third party, advertiser, or other user encrypted, hashed, or otherwise. Your username will be publically displayed to any user of the site. We require this display in order to visually differentiate user pages and lists, as well as allowing people to discover other users based on their username.</p>

        <h2>LOG DATA</h2>
        <p>
            We collect certain pieces of information as routine logs. These logs include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser, time and date of visit, and what pages you visit. We do not sell or transmit this data to any third party. These logs are used internally only to determine website errors and to help solve issues that users of our site may be facing. These logs are also routinely deleted so only the minimum amount of logs are kept.
            We do not use any third party monitoring or tracking software on our website. However, we provide links to outside resources and websites that we do not control. Thus, when clicking on a link to a third party site, you become subject to that site’s Terms of Service and Privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
        <p>We will only use your information in order to contact you due to account termination, or if you initiate contact with us for whatever reason. We do not communicate this data with any third party provider, advertiser, or other user.</p>

        <h2>COOKIES</h2>
        <p>We use cookies on StreamSurfer in order to make your logged in experience easier and more enjoyable. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, we require cookies in order to maintain your login session. We have taken steps to make sure your cookies are stored securely and only sent over HTTPS. The cookies that we send do not contain any user information except for a randomly generated piece of text unique to that session.</p>

        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
            We make sure to take steps to properly secure your data on our servers and secure your data in transit. We have TLS, an up to date method to encrypt and transport data between your browser and our server, implemented across every page of StreamSurfer. Certain pages are only accessible to a logged in user, such as account controls. We strive to make these pages secure using proper authentication controls and secure data transit.
            However, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to be 100% secure. We have taken many steps to make sure your data is secure but we can never guarantee anything. If you discover your data or another user’s data is at risk, please contact us right away and we will work to solve the issue. Please see our Terms of Service (https://streamsurfer.info/Home/tos) for more information on the liability of StreamSurfer.
        </p>
